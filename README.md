**[WIP]** PieCrust is an abstraction layer built on top of UIKit with handy protocols, extensions, syntactic sugar and more, to create iOS apps quickly and efficiently.

## Key Features
- Custom subclasses of all major UIKit objects with convenience initializers and helper methods to enable developing iOS apps quickly and efficiently.
- Easy keyboard events handling.
- Priceless list of [protocols](https://github.com/MobilionOSS/PieCrust/tree/master/Sources/Protocols) to add features to `UIKit` objects and make [Crusty](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/) proud :)
- Essential list of extensions for `SwiftStd` and `UIKit` classes.
- Generic table-view and collection-view controllers to make dealing with your models a joy!
- [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) included in the box, so you don't have to add that `import SnapKit` everywhere. 

## Requirements
- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 9+
- Swift 4+

## Installation

### CocoaPods
To integrate PieCrust into your iOS project using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), specify it in your Podfile:
