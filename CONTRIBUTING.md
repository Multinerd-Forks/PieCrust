## Submitting a Pull Request

Please refer to the following rules before submitting a pull request:

  - by doing this we can merge new pull-requests into master branch as soon as they are accepted, and add them to the next releases once they are fully tested.
- Always declare new objects as open if they are intended to be overridden, or public otherwise.

## Style Guidelines

Writing clean code and upholding project standards is as important as adding new features. To ensure this, PieCrust employs a few practices:

1. We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce style and conventions at compile time.
2. We adhere to the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).
